The "Geometric Calculator" is a comprehensive C++ program designed to facilitate mathematical computations related to various geometric shapes. With its intuitive interface and robust functionality, this calculator enables users to effortlessly determine key properties such as area, perimeter, volume, and surface area for a wide range of shapes.

By harnessing the power of mathematical formulas and algorithms, the calculator accurately performs calculations for shapes including circles, triangles, rectangles, squares, trapezoids, parallelograms, hexagons, octagons, ellipses, rhombuses, pentagons, cubes, spheres, cylinders, cones, pyramids, tori, tetrahedra, octahedra, and dodecahedra.

When initiating the program, users are presented with an interactive menu where they can select the desired shape from the extensive list. Upon choosing a shape, they are prompted to specify the calculation they wish to perform, be it the area, perimeter, volume, or surface area.

For instance, in the case of a circle, users can easily input the radius or diameter to calculate the corresponding area or circumference. Similarly, when dealing with a rectangle, they can provide the length and width to obtain the area or perimeter. The calculator's versatility ensures that it accommodates the unique requirements of each shape, catering to the specific properties and formulas associated with it.

By following a structured approach, the calculator seamlessly incorporates the user's input into the appropriate mathematical formula to yield the desired result. Complex calculations involving multiple variables, such as the volume of a sphere or the surface area of a cone, are efficiently executed using advanced mathematical principles and algorithms.

To enhance usability and provide a seamless user experience, the calculator employs error-handling techniques to ensure that users input valid values for each shape's parameters. This safeguards against erroneous or illogical calculations, thereby maintaining the integrity of the results.

The "Geometric Calculator" not only offers immediate access to mathematical solutions but also serves as an educational tool. Through its interactive interface and real-time calculations, users can develop a deeper understanding of geometric concepts and relationships, strengthening their mathematical skills and intuition.
